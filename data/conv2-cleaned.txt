Of course I did Real Madrid played really well and deserved to win Really I thought Real had more control over the game and created more scoring opportunities I can t deny that Messi is a great player but I still think Real deserved to win They were more organized and disciplined on the field We ll see about that Real Madrid has a strong team this year and I think they re going to be tough to beat Agreed It s always exciting to see these two teams go head to head no matter who comes out on top
